# Samit Malap

**Engineering Student | Backend-Focused Full Stack Developer (MERN)**

I am a driven software developer with a strong foundation in **backend development, database design, and SQL-driven applications**. I enjoy building **scalable, data-centric systems** and writing **clean, maintainable code** that solves practical problems.

My primary focus is on **backend logic, database optimization, and system flow**, with hands-on experience using the MERN stack. I also explore **image-based machine learning systems**, especially in real-world domains such as agriculture and image quality validation.
